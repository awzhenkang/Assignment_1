## The prupose of this website is to show what the restaurant has to offer to diners. People can browse the menu on the website, which can be convenient before visiting the restaurant. The website can also serve as an online ordering platform, which can reduce the interdependence on other delivery services.

### The design of the Home page is minimalistic, but attracts people's attention with interesting pictures of some of the food being served at the restaurant and the interior of the restaurant. It also indicates where the restuarant is located at, so that people can easily navigate their way here.

### The design of the Reservation Page is similar to the Home page, but now it involves a fill-in form for people who wish to make a reservation first before dining at the resturant. It collects both booking and personal details, with the address at the bottom left of the form.
