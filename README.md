# Assignment 1: The Marco's Restaurant Website

## The prupose of this website is to show what the restaurant has to offer to diners. People can browse the menu on the website, which can be convenient before visiting the restaurant. The website can also serve as a contact form, for diners to voice out any concerns after dining at the restaurant.

### Features being implemented is the Home Page, where it shows pictures of what food diners can expect when visiting the restauarnt. It shows a sneak peak of the interior , together with the exact location, so that customer can find our restaurant easily and also attract customers to dine.

The Resveration Page is where customers can place their resevration before visitng our restaurant. This will allow the people working there to reserve a seat for them once they have arrived at our restauarnt. Customers will also have to enter their phone number, so that our staff can contact them should the need arises.

The Menu Page offers customers special menus during the week for both lunch and dinner. This allows customers to try something special that is not on our menu. If customers do not want to try out the special menus, there is always the normal restauarnt menu to cater to our customers.

The Contact Us Page allows diners to write anything regarding the service, the staff and the food etc. With all this feedback from our wide range of customers, we can find out ways to improve on them, so as to make our overall dining restaurant experience memorable/exciting for those who have visited or are going to visit the restaurant. 

Some Features waiting to be implemented are the Order Online page, where customers can order directly from our website and not third-party apps like Grab or Foodpanda. The food will then be delivered from our very own staff, which will result in no delays when delivering the food to our customers.

A Memership page where customers can sign on to become a member on our website. The Memberships get to enjoy special benefits like Birthday Month discounts, speical offers, deals, 1-for-1 food items etc. When customers are already a memeber, they will get an account tied to the restaurant, which can be shown when making payment. 

A News page is where customers can read up where do our produce comes from, what is the backstory of our food items, personalised menus for people to try at home etc. This can be an exciting addition to our webpage.
